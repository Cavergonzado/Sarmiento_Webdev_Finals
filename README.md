What are the web tools you used to create your web app?
* __I have mostly used the Bootstrap CDN because of it's integrated components. It helped me achieve the professional theme of my website but for editing I used codepen.__

Discuss what you learned in this (a) COVID-19 web app project and (b) Web Development 1 Course/Subject. 
* __First, I learned that the COVID-19 disease is a serious matter and it affects not only the population but the government, economy, and mental health of individuals. Web development allowed me to make my vision into a reality. Learning the fundamentals such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript allowed me to be a striving web developer. By creating a website, I have grasp the idea of stepping up to make an action by helping others. I hope by establishing this website could serve it's purpose for the users and not only because we are required to do so.__
 
What is something you need to improve on Web Development?
* __I need to improve my time consumption, because as far as I observed, I take too much time making each website. For *cnu.org* it took me atleast 3 good days, working from 5pm-3am, to get the job done. I had to skip dinner twice. Although, the results were great but it was very time consuming.__
