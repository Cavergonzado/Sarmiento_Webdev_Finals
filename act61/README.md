## Assessment

For this activity, I learned to use the Bootstrap CDN. The lists of components I've used or added are the ff;

* Card Subtitles
  * _h6 class="card-subtitle”_
  * I used this component for the adding of the "likes" feature of Instagram.
* Lists Groups
  * _ul class="list-group list-group-flush"_
  * This allowed me to add the comment box and post button like how Instagram designed it to be.
* Group Item
  * _li class="list-group-item"_
  * I added this feature inside the lists group so that the comment box and post button will be kept in place.
* Align items
  * _div class="d-flex align-items-center"_
  * This class can align any elements and objects into the center. I used it to keep my elements inline.
* Navigation Bar
  * _nav class="navbar navbar-light sticky-top bg-light style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;"_
  * I tweaked the default nav bar set in the html code given with my own style. I added some css code to make it more similar to Instagram's.
* Container
  * _div class="container"></div_
  * I also tweaked the container, I added more values and attributes so that It'll make it more fuller.
